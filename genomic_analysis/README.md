# Overview 
This is a specialization course in R in genomic analysis from Harvard Edx. This is strictly for me to understand more data analysis after taking an upper div/graduate course at school where I realized how much I don't know. HOpefully this solves my issue but yeah, I have tried to answer these problems to the best of my abilties but don't hold your horses there man.
