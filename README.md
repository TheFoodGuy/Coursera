# Overview
This contains the code of all the coursera classes I have taken and the ones I actually remember to save back here.
To be frank, if someone who reads this directory wants some proof that I actually took the classes like paper of accomplishment... yeah buddy, I don't have it.
All I have are my works that I did so feel free to run them on the corresponding classes. 

Disclaimer: Just to be safe, it will for sure work with the content corresponding to the original dates these programs were submitted to github. Like genomic analysis, 
I noticed that if you move like a year and half later, the content are different to reflect the change in time which means my codes won't exactly work.
