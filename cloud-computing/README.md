# Overview 
This is the cloud computing specialization from University of illinois - UC 
There are six courses overall with 1 course long project. The directories are named based on their respective class names to avoid any confusions. Since I didn't paid for the subscription of the statement of accomplishment, all of my works will be here including the homeworks and guiding questions. 

# Overview on Concept Questions and Homework 
The way I am going to go about it is info-dump (jking) but I am going to explain my reasoning in like 2-3 sentences each questions. For the homework questions, my rationale will always be the last bullet point for each question. 

# Programming Assignment 
Once I get all the test cases working, I guess I'm done (however this is a bad mindset as the test cases could be easy as heck (cough cough ucsd-bioinformatics) while the actual grading is hard). What I am going to do is make a couple of more test cases to break my project and see where it goes from there. 

# Notes
Technically speaking, concept questions and homeworks are the notes but these notes are for myself and will be scanned onto github for further confirmation

# To anyone reading this I guess
You're welcome to read, use, and maybe copy (dude I hope not cause we gotta learn this stuff and you'll be better off doing it on your own). However, if you do want like a reference because you have been stuck and there is no one else available, here you go (stuck for a few days I guess?).
